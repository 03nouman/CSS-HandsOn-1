        other media.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="span-1">Css is not neccesary</span>

        multiple web pages all at once
      </li>
      <br />
      <li style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic">
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h1 class="h1-tag">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul id="unorder-list">
      <li style="color: brown; letter-spacing: 6px; font-size: 20px">
        Inline - by using the style attribute inside <b>HTML </b> HTML elements1
      </li>
      <li class="li-tag">
        Internal - by using a style element in the head section
      </li>
      <li id="li-tag">
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li class="list-tag">
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However,
        <span class="span-3"
          >in this <br />
          tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span
        >
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br />
        for you to try it yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element, ID is also <br />
      special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element
      and it's used by JavaScript
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the <br />
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
